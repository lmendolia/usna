Pillars of CyberSecurity

Confidentiality: preserving authorized restrictions on information access and disclosure; data-oriented
Integrity: guarding against improper information modification or destruction
Authentication: verify identity of user, process, or device
Non-Repudiation: protection against an individual falsely denying having performed a particular action
	ex: digital signatures
Availability: timely, reliable access to data and information services

Principles of Secure Cyber Design:
1. Sound Engineering
	a. KISS- keep it simple stupid...economy of mechanism
	b. Fail-Safe Defaults (Safety First)...deny first
	c. Complete Mediation (Vigilance on the Systems Part)
	d. Open Design
2. Privilege Management
	a. Separation of Privilage
	b. Least Privilege
3. User Considerations
	a. Least Common Mechanism: minimizes mechanism/memory that are common to multiple users
	b. Physchological Acceptability (Usability): design user interfaces for ease of use, so that 			security mechanisms are used correctly
4. Threat Considerations
	a. Work Factor: threat capabilties/effort required to circumvent a security mechanism
	b. Compromise Recording (logging): info sys should log so compromises can be detected
