why dynamic memory?
  works because you don't have to know how much memory you want
  it downloads x amount of bytes and adds more as you need it
  share memory between functions

malloc
  allows you to allocate and deallocate memory
  dynamic memory comes from heap

memory leak
  when you lose where the pointer is pointing to

calloc
  "count allocated"
  memory allocated is zeroed
  so how to do we tell the difference between an element that has been set and one that has not yet been set?
    double pointers
    a pointer to a pointer that points to something...if the thing that points to something hasn't been used...then we know

    #include <stdlib.h>
